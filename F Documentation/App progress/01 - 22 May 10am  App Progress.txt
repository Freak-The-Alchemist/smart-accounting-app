## **PHASE 2: Web Application Core Development**

### 2.1 Set up Web Routing
- **Action:**  
  - Create a `src/routes` or `src/App.tsx` in `packages/web` using `react-router-dom`.

## **PHASE 3: Implement Petrol Station Modules (Web)**

### 3.1 Implement Shift Management UI (Web)
- **Status:** Implemented, but ensure it’s accessible via navigation and fully tested.

### 3.2 Implement Expense Logging UI (Web)
- **Status:** Implemented, but ensure it’s accessible via navigation and fully tested.

### 3.3 Implement Inventory Management UI (Web)
- **Status:** Implemented, but ensure it’s accessible via navigation and fully tested.

### 3.4 Refine Web Dashboard
- **Status:** Implemented, but ensure all summary widgets and charts are connected to live data.

## **PHASE 4: Mobile Application Setup & Core Development**

### 4.1 Initialize Expo Project
- **Status:** `app.json` and structure exist. If not initialized, run `expo init` in `packages/mobile`.

### 4.2 Configure Monorepo for Mobile
- **Status:** `package.json` and `tsconfig.json` are set up for workspace imports.

### 4.3 Install Mobile Dependencies
- **Status:** Already present in `package.json`.

### 4.4 Set up Mobile Navigation
- **Action:**  
  - Use `@react-navigation/native` and `@react-navigation/native-stack`.
  - Create a `Navigator.tsx` with routes for Dashboard, Shift Log, Expenses, Inventory, Auth, etc.

### 4.5 Implement Core Mobile Layout and Navigation
- **Action:**  
  - Create a `BottomTabNavigator` or `DrawerNavigator` for main sections.
  - Use React Native Paper for UI consistency.

### 4.6 Integrate Firebase Authentication (Mobile)
- **Action:**  
  - Create login/signup screens.
  - Use the shared `useAuth` hook for authentication logic.
  - Add navigation guards for protected screens.

## **PHASE 5: Implement Petrol Station Modules (Mobile)**

### 5.1 Implement Shift Management UI (Mobile)
- **Status:** Implemented, but ensure it’s accessible via navigation and fully tested.

### 5.2 Implement Expense Logging UI (Mobile)
- **Status:** Implemented, but ensure it’s accessible via navigation and fully tested.

### 5.3 Implement Inventory Management UI (Mobile)
- **Status:** Implemented, but ensure it’s accessible via navigation and fully tested.

### 5.4 Refine Mobile Dashboard
- **Status:** Implemented, but ensure all summary widgets and charts are connected to live data.

---

## **PHASE 6: Feature Enhancements & Firebase Functions**

### 6.1 Implement OCR and Voice Input
- **Action:**  
  - Integrate Expo Camera/ML Kit for OCR (receipt scanning).
  - Integrate Expo Speech/Voice for voice input.
  - Connect these to expense and sales forms.

### 6.2 Develop Excel Report Export
- **Status:** Utility exists in `shared/src/utils/excelExport.ts`.
- **Action:**  
  - Add “Export” buttons to Dashboard, Expenses, and Sales screens (web & mobile).
  - On click, call the export utility with the relevant data.

### 6.3 Implement Firebase Functions
- **Action:**  
  - In `/firebase/functions`, write cloud functions for:
    - Scheduled report generation
    - Low stock alerts
    - Data aggregation
  - Deploy with `firebase deploy --only functions`.

### 6.4 Implement Detailed Firestore Security Rules
- **Action:**  
  - Edit `database.rules.json` to restrict access by user role and data ownership.
  - Test with the Firebase Emulator.

---

## **PHASE 7: Testing, Optimization, and Deployment**

### 7.1 Unit and Integration Testing
- **Action:**  
  - Write tests for shared logic, services, and UI components using Jest and Testing Library.

### 7.2 End-to-End Testing
- **Action:**  
  - Use Cypress (web) and Detox (mobile) for E2E tests.

### 7.3 Performance Optimization
- **Action:**  
  - Profile app performance, optimize Firestore queries, and lazy-load screens.

### 7.4 Prepare for Web Deployment
- **Action:**  
  - Build with `pnpm --filter @smart-accounting/web build`.

## **NEXT STEPS FOR YOU**

- **Connect all screens to navigation** (web: `react-router-dom`, mobile: `@react-navigation/native`).
- **Test all flows** (shift, expense, inventory, dashboard, export).
- **Implement advanced features** (OCR, voice, cloud functions, security rules).
- **Write and run tests** (unit, integration, E2E).
- **Deploy!**

If you want code for a specific missing screen, navigation setup, or advanced feature (OCR, voice, cloud functions, etc.), let me know which one to generate next!
