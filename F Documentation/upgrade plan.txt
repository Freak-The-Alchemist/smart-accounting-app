To tailor your Smart Accounting App specifically for a petrol station business, you'll want to adapt both features and data flows to match the specific operations of a petrol station. Here‚Äôs a targeted breakdown of how to modify your app accordingly:

üîß Customization Plan for Petrol Station Accounting
1. Core Modules to Add
These are specific to a petrol station:

‚õΩ Fuel Sales Tracking
Track liters dispensed per fuel type (e.g., petrol, diesel).

Daily meter readings per pump.

Price per liter (with automatic or manual update).

üßæ Shift-based Cash Register
Allow attendants to log their shift start/end.

Capture sales per shift.

Include cash, M-Pesa, and card payments.

üì¶ Stock & Inventory
Monitor fuel tank levels.

Track oil, lubricants, and other shop items.

Receive stock from suppliers and update inventory.

üìÑ Expense Logging
Quick input of daily operational expenses (e.g., power, water, security).

Categorize by expense type.

üë• Payroll Integration (Basic)
Track employee attendance (check-in/out via app).

Generate salary summaries from shift logs.

2. Modify Data Models (in shared folder)
You‚Äôll need to update your shared TypeScript types to include:

ts
Copy
Edit
// shared/types.ts

export interface FuelSale {
  date: string;
  pumpId: string;
  fuelType: 'Petrol' | 'Diesel';
  litersSold: number;
  pricePerLiter: number;
  totalAmount: number;
  paymentMethod: 'Cash' | 'M-Pesa' | 'Card';
  attendantId: string;
}

export interface Shift {
  attendantId: string;
  startTime: string;
  endTime?: string;
  sales: FuelSale[];
  totalCash: number;
  totalMpesas: number;
}

export interface StockItem {
  itemId: string;
  name: string;
  quantity: number;
  unit: string;
  purchasePrice: number;
  sellingPrice: number;
}

export interface Expense {
  date: string;
  category: string;
  amount: number;
  notes?: string;
}
3. Customize UI Components
In your web/ and mobile/ folders:

Dashboard Page:

Show daily fuel sales.

Top performing pumps.

Payment summary (cash vs. digital).

Stock alerts.

Shift Log Page:

Start/End shift.

Attach fuel sales and cash received.

Generate shift report.

Expense Input Page:

Categorized form (fuel delivery, utilities, security, etc.).

Attach photos of receipts using OCR.

Inventory Page:

Add/view items (oil, water, tyres, etc.)

Set low stock alert levels.

4. Excel Report Export Customization
Modify your Excel export logic to:

Include daily/weekly/monthly fuel sales per pump.

Expense vs. income summaries.

Inventory usage.

Profitability reports per shift or per fuel type.

5. Voice/OCR Input Enhancements
Use voice commands like:

‚ÄúRecord 200 liters petrol at pump 2.‚Äù

‚ÄúLog security payment Ksh 3,000.‚Äù

OCR can scan:

Delivery notes.

Cash deposit slips.

M-Pesa transaction summaries.

6. Realtime Sync + Firebase Usage
Firebase Firestore can sync:

Live fuel meter readings.

Shift logs as they‚Äôre recorded.

Stock updates across attendants and managers.

Use Firebase Functions to:

Auto-generate reports.

Send daily summary via email/WhatsApp.

Trigger low stock alerts.

‚úÖ Suggested Folder Addition
Add to shared/constants/fuel.ts:

ts
Copy
Edit
export const FUEL_TYPES = ['Petrol', 'Diesel'] as const;
And in firebase/ add Firestore rules tailored to:

Restrict attendants to their own shift records.

Admins see all data.

Secure expense reports and sales entries.
