# Smart Accounting App: Dual Collaboration System

## Overview

This document explains the dual collaboration model designed for the Smart Accounting App, which supports both **organization-based** and **independent accountant peer-to-peer collaboration**. The system empowers accounting professionals to work flexibly across different professional settings with accountability, transparency, and ease of use.

## 🔁 Collaboration Modes

### 1. Organization-Based Collaboration

* Accountants are grouped under a single organization (e.g., a firm or company).
* A **Chief Accountant** manages roles and access within the organization.
* Invite-only access to the org.
* Built-in **audit logs**, **role management**, and **shared file space**.

#### Key Benefits for Organizations:

* Centralized data and permissions
* Full control over who accesses what
* External auditors can be invited temporarily

### 2. Peer-to-Peer Collaboration (Independent Accountants)

* Accountants can create **projects** independently.
* Invite other accountants by email or link to collaborate.
* Each project has its own members, roles, and shared files.
* Not tied to an organization.

#### Key Benefits for Independent Accountants:

* Collaborate freely with other professionals
* Maintain flexibility without needing to form a formal firm
* Can be invited to organization audits without full membership

## 🔐 Permissions Model

Roles (per org or project):

* **Chief Accountant / Project Lead**: Full control
* **Accountant**: Edit access to files and data
* **External Auditor / Viewer**: Read-only or limited time access

---

## 🔧 System Architecture (Firebase)

### Firestore Collections:

* `users`: Stores account type, org/project membership, roles
* `organizations`: Org profile and members list
* `projects`: Independent projects with members
* `invites`: Temporary invite tokens with metadata
* `logs`: Activity tracking per org or project
* `files`: Shared documents with metadata

### Authentication:

* Firebase Auth with role-based logic via Firestore rules and Cloud Functions

---

## 🧠 Context Switching UI

Users can toggle between working under:

* An **Organization** context
* A **Project** context

This prevents data crossover and clarifies roles per workspace.

---

## 📋 Activity Logs

Every user action (file uploads, edits, invites) is logged with:

* Timestamp
* Context (org or project)
* User ID
* Action type

This promotes accountability and simplifies debugging.
